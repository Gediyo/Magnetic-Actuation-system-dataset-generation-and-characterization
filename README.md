# Magnetic Actuation system dataset generation and characterization

The Micro-robotics lab at the University of Toronto has developed an 8-coil magnetic actuation system
designed for use with magnetic medical instruments. The system generates a magnetic field to control
surgical tools while serving as an operating table. Currently, the magnetic field generated by the system has
only been calibrated for a small workspace around the center of the table.

In practice, surgical tools are required to operate across the entire 3D workspace above the operating
table. To ensure effective operation in this space, the magnetic field generated by the system needs to be
well-understood and controlled in all areas, not just at the center. This requires quantifying the magnetic
field through measurement over the entire workspace of the coil table. The collected data will then be used to
refine the existing model and develop an improved one using machine learning techniques for better control.
This project focuses on measuring the 3D magnetic field generated by the coil system to achieve these goals.
